# Instacart: Python Analysis
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. They have good sales, but they wanted to uncover patterns in these sales. I was tasked with performing initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
# Key Questions and Objectives
● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.  
● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.  
● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.  
● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.  
● What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?  
● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?  
● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?  
● Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?  
● What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?  
● What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customerprofiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.  
# Data
Instacart is a real company that at one point made data from their app available. The data for this project was provided by Career Foundary based off of “The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”, Accessed from www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 via Kaggle. This website is no longer accessible. The following data sets were fabricated by Career Foundary for this project.  
● Customers  
● Departments  
● Orders  
● Orders_products_prior  
● Products  
# Tools
The following Python libraries were used in this project:  
● Pandas: for data analization  
● Seaborn: for data visualization  
● Matplotlib: for data visualization  
● Numpy: for mathematical equations  
● SciPy: for mathematical equations  
# Folders
The project files are divided between the following folders:  
● Project Management: Project Brief  
● Data: not uploaded to GitHub due to size
● Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.  
● Analysis: The visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.  
● Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel
